# Elevate.api

A simplified `elevator model` in Python. We'll ignore a lot of what goes into a real world elevator, like physics, maintenance overrides, and optimizations for traffic patterns. Main feature is to decide whether the elevator should go up, go down, or stop. 

This is built using Python & Django (`Django Rest Framework` specifically with ViewSets, Serializers etc) using `PostgreSQL` as database.

An elevator system, which can be initialised with N elevators and maintains the elevator states as well.
